# API Reference

Base URL: `http://<host>:<port>/api`

Versioned aliases are available for selected endpoints under `/api/v1`. All
endpoints return JSON unless the route explicitly serves an image or stream.
Errors return `{ "error": "<message>" }` with an appropriate HTTP status code.

API routes are protected by a lightweight in-memory rate limiter by default:

- `API_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` (default: `true`)
- `API_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` (default: `240`)
- `API_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default: `60`)
- `API_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_BUCKETS` (default: `4096`)
- `STREAMFLOW_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` (default: empty)

`X-Forwarded-For` is ignored unless the direct peer belongs to a configured
trusted proxy network. StreamFlow does not currently provide its own UI/API
login. Treat the API as a trusted-LAN-only control plane and do not expose it
directly to the internet. Adding a StreamFlow authentication boundary is a
separate compatibility decision.

Dispatcharr and Shadow watcher secrets can be supplied without saving them in
StreamFlow configuration files:

- `DISPATCHARR_API_KEY_FILE` or `DISPATCHARR_API_KEY`
- `DISPATCHARR_PASS_FILE` or `DISPATCHARR_PASS`
- `SHADOW_WATCHER_API_KEY_FILE` or `SHADOW_WATCHER_API_KEY`

The `*_FILE` source takes precedence and fails closed if it cannot be read. API
responses report only whether a secret is configured and never return its value.

Single-stream checks accept `stream_id`, `id`, `stream_reference`, or
`stream_ref`. They can measure an unassigned Dispatcharr stream while regex
rules are being prepared. A check still consumes provider and analysis capacity.

## Shadow Monitor

| Method | Path | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| GET | `/api/shadow-blank-monitor/config` | Read Continuous Monitoring configuration |
| PUT | `/api/shadow-blank-monitor/config` | Update Continuous Monitoring configuration |
| GET | `/api/shadow-blank-monitor/status` | Viewer, probe, switch, cooldown, and decision state |

| POST | `/api/shadow-blank-monitor/offline-image/learn` | Learn an offline-image reference |

`GET /api/shadow-blank-monitor/config` returns a persistent, monotonically
increasing `config_revision`. Send it back as `expected_config_revision` (or as
the unchanged `config_revision` field from the GET response) on PUT. A stale
precondition returns HTTP `409` with code `shadow_config_revision_conflict` and
a redacted current configuration. `included_channel_ids` and
`included_channel_uuids` provide an explicit monitor allowlist; both empty means
all active viewer channels, and exclusions always take precedence.

Provider telemetry uses `availability_percentage`. The misspelled V7 field
`availability_pecentage` remains temporarily available with the same value for
compatibility.
